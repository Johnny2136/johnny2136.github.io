Just another software engineer trying to keep my coding skills relevant in an age where technology is changing at an ever quickening pace.

### More Information

I started learning to code in 1985 while studying in collage college working with a main frame (HP2000) using COBOL and FORTRAN. I graduated college after a long hiatus in 2006. I have worked in both the hardware (electronics) as well as the software realms of computing. I am sort of a “jack-of-all-trades” Since I work for the government, I have had a large amount of project management experience, but my passion is code and technology innovation.
